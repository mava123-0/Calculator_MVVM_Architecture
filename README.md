## MVVM Architectrue
The goal of MVVM architecture is to make the view completely independent from the application logic. The View only communicates with the ViewModel and the ViewModel only communicates with the Model.

### View
The View represents the user interface of the application.

### ViewModel
The ViewModel is the link between the View and the Model. It implements and exposes public properties and commands that the View uses by way of data binding. If any state changes occur, the ViewModel notifies the View through notification events.
